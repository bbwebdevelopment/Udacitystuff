        <p> this page was a practice run with setting up the correct doctype
          declaration which determines the rendering mode that the website
          will use to display the page. I have added a header tag and paragraph
           tag for this page as additional practice.
          I have also added a title within the head as this is
          responsible for certain actions like the  < title > tag,  the Charset
           being used listed after meta which is written as
           < meta charset="utf-8" but listed before the title in the
            head asocciated css files for style which is represented
            as < link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css. the
            left arrow must be right in front of first letter,I altered the
             addition to ensure it was visible.
             <!--second try at a doctype HTML webpage, upon further review
             I have found multiple errors I made. closing html,head, body and
             paragrah tags were missing, I have added them on 2/01/18.-->
