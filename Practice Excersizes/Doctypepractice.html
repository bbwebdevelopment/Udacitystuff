<!DOCTYPE HTML>
  <html>
    <head>
      <title>New journey</title>
      <Body>
        <h1>Doctype HTML 01/20/18</h1>
        <P> this page was a practice run with setting up the correct doctype declaration which determines the rendering mode that the website will use to display the page. I have added a header tag and paragraph tag for this page as additional practice.
          I have also added a title within the head as this is responsible for certain actions like the  < title > tag,

          the Charset being used listed after meta which is written as < meta charset="utf-8" but listed before the title in the head
          asocciated css files for style which is represented as < link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css. the left arrow must be right in front of first letter,I altered the addition to ensure it was visible.
        </P>
