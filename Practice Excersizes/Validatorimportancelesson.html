<h1>Validation practice</h1>
<!--largest heading tag available, will usually show in bold format, headers
can range 1-6 but typically after 4th it blends with regular fonts in size-->
<p>This script started with a simple header tag stating this is title.
  the tag was validated and threw multiple errors, applying doctype, html,
  head, body, charset tags allowed the code to validated properly,
  with a "document checking completed, no errors or warnings to show."
   upon copying the my source from the return of the validator,
   it has added return symbols to the webpage.

 <!-- typical paragraph tag, always keep in mind, beginning and ending tags,
 upon review I found a missing ending paragraph tag. tags always <p> </p>-->
